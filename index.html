        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>My name is Frank Naomi and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. See, I always wanted to study Engineering or Mathematics growing up and this was because I was good at maths and I felt it was in line with my favorite subjects then. Well, I wasn't allowed to choose Engineering or Mathematics when applying due to a combination of me having too many migraines, my mum believing I might go insane if I pursued that field and it being too masculine all according to my parents. </p>
        <p>Anyway, it seems fate has other plans for me as now I an actively chasing a career here, several years later. I joined AltSchool after seeing so much buzz about it and actively researching it because I believe that more than just the curriculum, the community was amazing and I felt I would thrive there. Seeing the interaction between alumni, staff and current student pushed me to registering and so far it has been a good journey. I hope to finish this programme with a good grasp of engineering concepts to help navigate my career. I want to work in Health Tech and I know this will be pivotal to my chosen path. </p>
        <p>Enough of me, here's a <a href="./form.html">link</a> to a registration form if you want to join me on this adventure</p>
